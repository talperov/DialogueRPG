# DialogueRPG
2D Retro Styled Dialogue RPG, inspired by the original Fallout RPG Series. Has a little bit of a twist by going on the Medieval Route.
The goal of this fun little mini project is to get better at understanding the SFML library and what it is capable of, as well as tryna show off and flex a little bit
of my understanding of Data Structures and Creative Programming, thinking that I have achieved over this year-long learning.

I want to make a decision-based action RPG that alters gameplay based on Dialogue choices. I'll most likely have AI generate the dialogue while I have the system and logic itself done by me, since I would be changing it based on what I feel is the right mood.

Main Goal of this Program/Project/Game Details Below:
* Have fun, this is the main goal after all
* Understand how Game Development Works
* Learning and adapting to a new somewhat language (SFML)
* Show my understanding of Programming and Development
* Show my understanding of Big O Time Complexity
* Show my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Again, just to have fun, this is a personal project after all, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

Here's the link to the game!!!
